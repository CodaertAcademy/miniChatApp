# miniChatApp

# This project is part of the curriculum of a Codaert Academy Course on JavaScript Web Development and has been given to a student of the course in order to test his prominence in the course of study so far.

Building a miniChatApp with Cloud firestore


Using the tools bootstrap, sass and Cloud Firestore, design a functioning chating web app

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The chatApp will have an authentication page.
- The home page will consist of a feature where a user can create a chat room.
- The chat room will have a unique ID which the user can use to invite someone else to the room.
- The user (creator of the room) determines the maximum amount of people that can be in the room.
- The users in a chat room can chat with each other (just like in a chat room) and they can also decide to leave the room when the want to.
- Users can delete any chat message that has been sent in the chat room provided that they are the owners of the chat message.
- Users can update their displayName (you do not need to create a profile page for this, this feature should be on the home page as well)


Hint
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Whatsapps group chat is an example of what the chatApp will be like.
- You are free to either make this a one-page webapp or a multiple page webapp.
- Try to give some alert notification for when things happen (eg. when the user updates his displayName, when a new user joins a chat room, when a user leaves a chat room)


Rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You are free to use any assisting plugin to build this, but you are not allowed to use any framework (angular, react, vue etc).
- All you code pages will be committed to this repo...but you are free to fork this repo in your own github account.
- Under no circumstance will you update this readMe file.
- The duration of this project is 2 weeks
